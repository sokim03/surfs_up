- The slight differences in statistics between the two months may be due to the amount of data collected. In the month of June, 1700 temperatures were recorded giving us more data to trend; as opposed to 1517 temperatures recorded in December.

## Summary:
Because of small differences in statistics, it is safe to say that the temperatures between the two months does not change drastically and that the weather is consistent throughout the year. This gives us more reason to determine that it may be safe to open W.Avy's surf and ice cream shop year round.
To give further analysis, queries such as determining the precipitation of the area and humidity and wind/pressure may also contribute to deciding to open up the shop year round. 
These queries can allow for better decisions on when the shop could be open/closed to better serve customers and also to avoid any business losses.
